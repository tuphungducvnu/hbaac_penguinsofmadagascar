Daily sales quantity forecasting for 56 days across 15,972 SKUs of a Vietnamese auto parts distributor.
Competition metric: WRMSSE (Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error, profit-weighted). Lower is better.

## Project Overview
**Task:** Given ~5 years of transaction history (2020-11-17 → 2025-09-05), predict daily net sales quantity for each SKU over two 28-day windows:
- **Validation window** (Public LB): F1–F28 = 2025-09-06 → 2025-10-03
- **Evaluation window** (Private LB): F29–F56 = 2025-10-04 → 2025-10-31

**Core Pipeline:**
1. Preprocessing: Standardized data loading with anomaly handling (clipping returns).

2. Feature Engineering: Extraction of 16 key features capturing sparsity, recency, trend, and intermittency.

3. Intelligent Segmentation: A LightGBM Multi-class Classifier partitions SKUs into three distinct operational clusters.

4. Strategic Routing:

- DEAD: Constant 0 prediction.

- SPARSE: Decayed daily rate modeling.

- ACTIVE: Ensemble of EWM and recent-window trends with day-of-week seasonality adjustment.

5. Post-processing: Forced zero-demand for Sundays (store closed).


## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

| Segment | Forecasting Strategy | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DEAD** | Zero Forecast | Items with no sales > 730 days |
| **SPARSE** | Decayed Daily Rate | Low-volume items (< 20 active days) |
| **ACTIVE** | EWM + DOW Scaling | High-frequency, trend-driven items |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Hyperparameters

The pipeline is highly tunable via the `CONFIG` section. Key parameters include:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EWM_ALPHA` | `0.15` | Smoothing factor for EWM; higher values increase reactivity. |
| `EWM_WEIGHT` | `0.60` | Blend weight between EWM and Recent-Window mean. |
| `SPARSE_CUTOFF` | `20` | Minimum active days to qualify a SKU as "ACTIVE". |
| `DEAD_SKU_CUTOFF` | `730` | Days since last sale to categorize as "DEAD". |
| `RECENT_WINDOW` | `56` | Days used to calculate recent mean performance. |

# 🛠️ Setup & Execution # 
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.8+, pandas, numpy, lightgbm, scikit-learn

**Installation:**
- Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

- Install requirement: pip install pandas numpy lightgbm scikit-learn

- Execution: Simply run the main pipeline script: python forecast_model_lgbm.py
The script will output the processed submission_lgbm.csv in the root directory and print a summary of the segment distribution and validation sanity checks to the console.

## Performance Tracking
The model aims to optimize the Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (WRMSSE). By isolating "Sparse" and "Dead" SKUs, the model prevents noise from distorting the trends of high-volume "Active" items, leading to more stable and accurate predictions across the catalog.
